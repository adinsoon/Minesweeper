**[SFML Required]**

## Abstract 
View below is the original look of the project 

It was my really first project in C++.
Compared to the original version it's only improved in the context of code transparency and purity and nothing else because it would be too much interference in the primary design. By not editing it too much, I also wanted to show the development of my programming thinking by presenting my first projects almost unchanged

## Description 
The project consist of:
  * interactive menu:
    - game mode selection 
  * game window
  * message boxes:
    - a message suited to the result of the game
    
The game also includes soundtracks:
1. While clicking
2. Winning
3. Losing
